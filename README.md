## ## Getting started
Install all project dependencies by executing and quickstart the application by running:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

It is necessary to have a running instance of the [Hackersplit API](https://github.com/nunofmn/hackersplit)

## Developing
```shell
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Testing

Run the tests by executing:

```shell
npm test
```

### Building

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
